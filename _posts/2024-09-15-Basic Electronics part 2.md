In order for you to physically make circuits, you need to know the basic concepts of electronics.

---

## Wires

A wire is a metallic conductor. Its purpose is to allow the flow of current through itself.
There are 2 types of wires
**Solid core** and **Soft core**

## Resistors

A resistor is also a conductor but it has a unique property. It doesn't fully accommodate the flow of current through it. It resists the flow of current to a certain extent. Its purpose is to decrease the flow of current to a certain extent.
There are multiple types of resistors but the one you need to be aware of right now is the **Carbon Film Resistor**.

## Input

There are multiple ways to get an input in a physical circuit. It can be done from a **pushbutton**, a **switch** or even other logic circuits.

The Input can be whatever you wish it to be, the only rule is that it must have 2 distinct values, **HIGH** and **LOW**.

### Example

The following is an example of a pushbutton being used as an input. When pressed, the "pin" receives an input of **LOW** and when the pushbutton is released, the "pin" receives an input of **HIGH**.
