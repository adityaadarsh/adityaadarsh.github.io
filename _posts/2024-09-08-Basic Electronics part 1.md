## Conductors

A conductor is anything that allows electricity to pass through it. It provides the medium needed for the flow of electrons.

## Insulators

An insulator is the opposite. It doesn't allow electricity to pass through it. It serves as way a of stopping flow of electricity. In electronics they are widely used for casing and covering.

## Voltage or Potential Difference

> SI Unit : Volts (V) <br> Symbol : V

It is the measure of the difference in electric potential between 2 points. It serves as the driving force of electrons, causing them to move from one point to another.

$$Voltage = \frac{Work}{Charge}$$

Where **Work** refers to the total work done to move the charges and **Charge** refers to the total charge moved.

> In symbols <br> > $$V = \frac{W}{Q}$$

1 Volt is the electric potential needed to do 1 Joule of work by moving 1 Coulomb of charge through the entire circuit.

## Current

> SI Unit : Amperes (A) <br> Symbol : I

It is the rate of flow of charge per unit time.

$$Current = \frac{Charge}{time}$$

Where **Charge** refers to the total charged moved and **time** refers to the time during which the charge was moving.

> In symbols <br> > $$I = \frac{Q}{t}$$

1 Ampere is when 1 Coulomb of charge is moved around the entire circuit in 1 Second.

## Resistance

> SI Unit : Ohms (Î©) <br> Symbol : R

It is the ability of a material to resist the flow of electric current through it. It is a property possessed by all materials.

$$Resistance = \frac{Voltage}{Current}$$

Where **Voltage** refers to the potential difference being applied across the material and **Current** refers to the current in the material.

> In symbols <br> > $$R = \frac{V}{I}$$

1 Ohms is the resistance which limits the current to 1 Ampere when 1 Volt of electric potential is applied.

## Power

> SI Unit : Watt (W) <br> Symbol : P

It is the rate of work done per unit time.

$$Power = \frac{Work}{time}$$

Where **Work** is the work done and **time** is the time during which the work was done.

> In symbols <br> > $$P = \frac{W}{t}$$

This equation is also used to derive the equation:
$$Power = Current \times Voltage$$

Where **Current** is the current present in the material and **Voltage** is the potential difference across the material.

> In symbols <br> > $$P = IV$$

## Anode

It is the positive terminal of an electric component.

## Cathode

It is the negative terminal of an electric component.
