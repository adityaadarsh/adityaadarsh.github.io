Oscilloscope Online is as the name suggests, a website that can let you use your computer as an oscilloscope for free rather than going to the trouble of buying one on your own which will leave your pockets empty.

You can find more information [here](https://kinghowler.github.io/projects/Oscilloscope-Online/)
