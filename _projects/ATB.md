# Description and purpose

A utility tool for assisting in the development of a Robotic Arm.
Contains the following :

1. A port viewer : To view the available Serial Ports
2. A Serial Monitor : To view if data is being received, and if it is in the correct format
3. A Gyroscope Reader : A visual representation of the Pitch and Roll of the appropriate sensors, to view if the Robotic Arm is moving in the correct manner or not
4. A Servo Arm Controller : To manually control the servo arm, useful for finding hardware faults and malfunctions
